# Flowbite + Laravel + Tailwind CSS Components Starter

This repository provides a real-world, ready-to-use starter project demonstrating how to integrate and utilize [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) components within a new [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) application, styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

If you're looking for a quick way to kickstart your next Laravel project with beautiful, interactive UI components out-of-the-box, this is the perfect starting point!

## What is Flowbite?

Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built on top of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and powered by JavaScript. It provides a vast collection of pre-designed, responsive, and interactive components like:

* Accordions
* Carousels
* Modals
* Collapse elements
* Speed Dials
* Dismissible alerts
* Drawers
* Dropdowns
* Popovers
* Tabs
* Tooltips
* Input Counters
* Datepickers
* ...and many more!

By using Flowbite, you can significantly speed up your development process, ensuring your application has a modern and consistent look and feel without spending countless hours on custom CSS and JavaScript.

## What's Included in This Starter?

This repository showcases practical examples of various Flowbite components integrated directly into a standard Laravel setup. You'll find implementations for components such as:

* **Home:** A basic landing page.
* **Accordion:** Collapsible content panels.
* **Carousel:** Image sliders.
* **Modal:** Pop-up dialogs.
* **Collapse:** Toggleable content sections.
* **Speed Dial:** Floating action buttons with multiple options.
* **Dismiss:** Dismissible alert messages.
